## Overview
This project is about an Advice generator fetching from an API.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process
This time I tried to use Vite and Typescript to make things a bit more interesting, then I started with the default styles and themes, created the card component with typed props and their respective styles. All the styles were made using styled components.

Using Axios I did a get request to fetch the data dinamically generating data for each click on the dice. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Axios
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Vite
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
### What I learned

I learned how to set a Vite project with Typescript, how to type props and make axios request using types.
### Continued development

I want to continue using Vite and Typescript, they both make the work a lot less stressfull.

Typescript and Vite are really powerful together, the package creation and build time with Vite is impressive. Working with typescript make finding bugs a lot easier and helpful if you leave your console open.
